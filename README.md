# Petra
Share your spendings with your loved ones

| :warning:  This program currently is in an alpha-like state and was written to only fit my very special needs |
|-----------------------------------------|
| I'm planning on rewriting more or less the whole program to be more usable and comfortable |

If you want to use it anyways:

Use [cargo-leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/cargo-leptos) as a build tool and provide a [tink](tink.com) id, secret and url in the tink.toml file that sould get generated after the first use

Hmmâ€¦ i think you currently can't create users from the petra cli. The code to create a user from the cli is only commented out because of some restructuring and i haven't fixed it yet.
So feel free to make the required functions public in your own copy of the code or wait until i find some time to fix it.
